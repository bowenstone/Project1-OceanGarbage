            <p>Gyres are large systems of circulating ocean currents, kind of like slow-moving whirlpools. 
                There are five gyres to be exact—the North Atlantic Gyre, the South Atlantic Gyre, 
                the North Pacific Gyre, the South Pacific Gyre, and the Indian Ocean Gyre—that have a 
                significant impact on the ocean. The big five help drive the so-called oceanic conveyor 
                belt that helps circulate ocean waters around the globe. While they circulate ocean waters, 
                they’re also drawing in the pollution that we release in coastal areas, known as marine debris.

            <p>The most famous example of a gyre’s tendency to take out our trash is the Great Pacific Garbage 
                patch located in the North Pacific Gyre. The patch is an area of concentrated (and mostly plastic) 
                marine debris. While this is certainly the most talked about garbage patch, it is not the only 
                garbage patch in the ocean. In the last five years, researchers have discovered two more areas where 
                a “soup” of concentrated marine debris collects – one in the South Pacific Ocean, the other in the 
                North Atlantic. As with the North Pacific Garbage Patch, plastic can circulate in this part of the 
                ocean for years, posing health risks to marine animals, fish, and seabirds.
